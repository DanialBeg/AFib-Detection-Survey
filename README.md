# AFib-Detection-Survey
*Authors: Danial Beg and Sahithi Chimmula*

This project aims to detect atrial fibrilation (AFib) utilizing ECG waveform data provided in the PTB-XL dataset. A write-up of this project will be included soon but feel free to check our [final presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11tC2UQEtE6XmAJ3CLjxVw6vJAPjzYQzvVvH-oDwDBV0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Datasets
Some of the datasets are too big to include on GitHub and thus can be downloaded from the following links: [ecgeq-500hzsrfava.npy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ah1yqVCcW7cpN0mRJX9px1NWpYygi6CG/view?usp=share_link) and [af_dataset.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fErgzku6iusVsB5RxPjy4pKiCeOhbFFA/view?usp=share_link)

Once downloaded, please put them into the data folder to run the notebooks.
